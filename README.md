CS251
=====
Code written for Professor Reed's [CS 251 class (data structures)](https://sites.google.com/site/cs251fall2014/) for Fall 2014 at UIC.

Some stuff about linked lists, trees, tries, and graphs. Nothing fancy (very ugly hackety C/C++ code). You may use this code freely (at your own risk).
